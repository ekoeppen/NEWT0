// by staff writers                                                           //
//                                                                            //

//         The SAG is one of the major products developed via the Information //
// Superhighway, the brain child of Al Gore, US Vice President.  The ISHW     //
// is being developed with massive govenment funding, since studies show      //
// that it already has more than four hundred users, three years before       //
// the first prototypes are ready.  Asked whether he was worried about the    //
// foreign influence in an expensive American Dream, the vice president       //
// said, ``Finland?  Oh, we've already bought them, but we haven't told       //
// anyone yet.  They're great at building model airplanes as well.  And _I   //
// can spell potato.''  House representatives are not mollified, however,     //
// wanting to see the terms of the deal first, fearing another Alaska.        //
//         Rumors about the SAG release have imbalanced the American stock    //
// market for weeks.  Several major publishing houses reached an all time     //
// low in the New York Stock Exchange, while publicly competing for the       //
// publishing agreement with Mr. Wirzenius.  The negotiations did not work    //
// out, tough.  ``Not enough dough,'' says the author, although spokesmen     //
// at both Prentice-Hall and Playboy, Inc., claim the author was incapable    //
// of expressing his wishes in a coherent form during face to face talks,     //
// preferring to communicate via e-mail.  ``He kept muttering something       //
// about jiffies and pegs,'' they say.                                        //
//         ...                                                                //
